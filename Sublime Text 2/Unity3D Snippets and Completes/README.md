# Unity3D Snippets and Completes
#### for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

## About
This sublime Text 2 package adds a number of helpful snippets and completes for working with Unity3D.

## Usage
Current not so many have really been added just a couple of the GUI functions.
Typing the tab trigger "gui" will give you quick access to the 6 most used GUI functions.

Please feel free to fork this package and add your own snippets. I will try to add a few more each day until many of the Unity functions are covered. 

## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Select Unity3D Snippets and Completes when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.

If you have some problems or improvements with it, contact me via GitHub.
