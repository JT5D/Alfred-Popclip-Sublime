# Sleeplessmind Color Scheme for Sublime Text 2/3/4

The scheme spreads some love to variables, comments and all the things you'll need to code in HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, Ruby, etc...

# Color Scheme, not UI Theme

This is a Color Scheme, not a UI Theme, so it doesn't change the tabs or the sidebar. But it mixes pretty well with the [Soda Dark UI Theme](http://buymeasoda.github.com/soda-theme/) if you need that.

# Who did I steal that from

The scheme is almost entirely based on [Clouds Midnight](http://fredhq.com/projects/clouds/) from Fred LeBlanc. But my comments and highlights are better, his suck.
